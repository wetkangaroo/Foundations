        <h1>Top 3 favorite websites</h1>
       <ul>
           <li>guess1981.com</li>
           <li>red-monkeys.com</li>
           <li>skullcandy.com</li>
           <li>Another notable site would be http://www.cloud330experience.com/eng/.  This site is amazing.</li>
        </ul>         
        <p></p> 
        <h1>What do you feel is the primary color used on the website?</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>guess1981.com uses black and white equally as the primary colors.</li>
            <li>red-monkeys.com uses a pastel blue as its primary color.</li>
            <li>skullcandy.com uses black as its primary color.</li>
        </ol>
    <p></p>
        <h1>Do you feel the mood/feeling of the color matches the purpose of the site?</h1>
         <ol>
            <li>guess1981.com uses black and white equally as the primary colors. I believe they are going for a nastaligic feel which I believe they accomplish by using these two colors.</li>
            <li>red-monkeys.com uses a pastel blue as its primary color.  I feel they achieve the mood earthiness and calmness.  But on the flipside they exert a kind of serene calmness in a creative manner.</li>
            <li>skullcandy.com uses black as its primary color.  I feel they definitely accomplish the mood I feel they are trying to achieve.  I feel since this product has to do with music, music is a lot of times associated with black.</li>
        </ol>
    <p></p>
        
        <h1>Who do you believe are the primary users of the site? </h1>
           <ol>
            <li>guess1981.com I feel are seeking chic, fashionable, young people.</li>
            <li>red-monkeys.com I feel, although I don't understand the language, is seeking young, intuitive, creative younger clientelle.</li>
            <li>skullcandy.com I feel is seeking a younger crowd even in its name.  Younger people today are tied very closely to their phones and music.</li>
        </ol>
    <p></p>
           <h1>Does the website's chosen design cater 
                to that user base, if so how? </h1>
           <ol>
            <li>guess1981.com I feel are seeking chic, fashionable, young people.I believe they are reaching their clientelle as I see many fashinable, beautiful people wearing this brand.  I do not see the older clas wearing Guess as much.</li>
            <li>red-monkeys.com I feel is probably reaching the creative crowds judging by the creativity of their website.</li>
            <li>skullcandy.com I feel is seeking a younger crowd even in its name.  I know they are reaching their target clientell as my kids have owned Skullcandy headphones.  I have also seen many kids wearing those headphones.</li>
        </ol>
    <p></p>
        
         <h1>What are the users' tasks and goals by 
                visiting the site? </h1>
           <ol>
            <li>guess1981.com is a shopping site.  It mixes nostalgia clothing with a modern twist.  Users can experience nostalgia by clicking on old phots of clothes that were sold 30 years ago that have been brought back.  This is accomplished perfectly by Guess where the user can buy an old look in a modern time.</li>
            <li>red-monkeys.com seems to draw the eccentric hipsters to their site.  Again I don't understand the language but the user can experience pleasurable rollovers in vibrant colors.  The rollovers seem to be tailored links of useful, everyday life needs as well as vacationing spots, car rentals, etc.  It reminds me of a "one stop shop" for life's needs and wants.  </li>
            <li>skullcandy.com is seeking the audio lovers.  Their product targets the younger generation.  This site allows the user to "feel cool", hip, and contemporary in my opinion.  The user can experience videos of the products to kind of get a feel before they buy.</li>
        </ol>
    <p></p>
        
        <h1>Is this task/goal easy to accomplish or find 
                and does the site showcase this information? </h1>
           <ol>
            <li>guess1981.com is a shopping site.  Guess makes this task very easy for the user to accomplish.</li>
            <li>red-monkeys.com seems seems to be a bit confusing but that may be because I do not understand the language.  However, there are many links on one page that you can click on and it seems to be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>skullcandy.com definitely accomplishes this I feel from its sheer simplicity.  It isn't overwhelming, there aren't that many products to search through so they may have an advantage for that reason.</li>
        </ol>
    <p></p>
        <h1>Do you feel the site succeeds in providing 
                a good user experience (UX)? </h1>
           <ol>
            <li>guess1981.com is an amazing interactive site that definitely makes the user want to come back for more.  Very visually appealing very easy to use.</li>
            <li>red-monkeys.com again is visual appealing but as far as not knowing the language, I don't really know how it flows.  However, I can say that the site definitely caught my eye. It made me very curious as to what it had to offer.  </li>
            <li>skullcandy.com definitely accomplishes this in a way of contemporary looks mixed with a popular product.  The user has a great experience with a perfect balance of information mixed with just enough clicking to get to where you want to go and know what you want to know without being inundated with a bunch of useless information.
