Notes:
	Begin with the Boostrap starting point we made on Thursday.
	Remember, with Boostrap it's all about structuring your HTML and applying class names from the documentation.
	If you need to add space between elements, remember to use <br/> tags.
	No custom CSS styling was used to accomplish the example page images, but feel free to tweak colors, fonts, padding, etc if you wish to give it a personal touch.
	Avoid applying positioning or width/heights on Boostrap controls/components to prevent having sizing issues.
	Feel free to look at the examples on Bootstap's documentation page for ideas (http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples).
