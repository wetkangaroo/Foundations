        <h1>Red</h1>
            <p>When I see RED I usually associate with sports for some reason. </p>
        <h1>Orange </h1>
            <p>Orange reminds me of my favorite alcoholic beverage, Henry's Hard Orange.</p>
        <h1>Yellow</h1>
            <p>Yellow reminds me of being in college in 1991 because I used a lot of yellows in my art class.  We used to joke that the teacher graded us better if we used mustard yellow because he liked that color.</p>
        <h1>Green</h1>
            <p>Green reminds me of grass and trees.</p>
        <h1>Blue</h1>
            <p>Blue reminds me of water and the sky.</p>
        <h1>Purple</h1>
            <p>Purple for some reason always reminds me of purple candy or purple passion.</p>
        <h1>White</h1>
            <p>White always makes things seem clean.  Unless its any off white, which to me has the absolute opposite effect.</p>
        <h1>Gray</h1>
            <p>Gray reminds me of getting older.  Having gray hair.</p>
        <h1>Black</h1>
            <p>Black is my favorite.  Most everything I wear is black.  It reminds me of rock and roll kind of.</p>
